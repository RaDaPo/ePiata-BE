# ePiata-BE

Our app is focused on helping the small farmers who grow natural and healthy food sell their products to the consumers.  We are creating an interface between the farmers and the consumers, like a real market but online, easy to use and without the multiple levels of intermediaries. The money goes directly from the consumer to the farmer, and with this we are encouraging the young generations from the rural areas to grow food and to grow it good. No more jokes like "de ce sunt rosiile galbene?, pentru ca sunt verzi..."
